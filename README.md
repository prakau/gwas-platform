# Genome-Wide Association Study Platform for Plant Breeding

This project provides an open-source platform for conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to accelerate plant breeding. The platform allows plant breeders to upload genotyping and phenotyping data, perform GWAS analysis, and visualize the results.

## Features

- Efficient pipelines for processing and storing large-scale genotyping data
- Optimized statistical methods for GWAS, including mixed linear models
- Interactive visualizations of GWAS results, including Manhattan plots and Q-Q plots
- Integration with plant genomics databases for data enrichment
- User-friendly web interface for data upload, analysis, and visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
3. Set up the database by running `database_integration.py`
4. Start the application by running `app.py`
5. Access the platform in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. Upload genotyping and phenotyping data in CSV format using the provided web interface
2. Select the trait of interest and run the GWAS analysis
3. Explore the interactive visualizations of GWAS results, including Manhattan plots and Q-Q plots
4. Integrate with external plant genomics databases for data enrichment and further analysis
5. Interpret the significant marker-trait associations and use them for marker-assisted selection in plant breeding programs
